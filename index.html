            Hello there!
	    <br>
            I am a senior at the University of Maryland graduating in Fall 2023. 
            I am pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science and am considering a masters down the road.
	    <br>
            For now, my goal is to get an internship or job in any Computer Science or Data Science related field!
        <br>
            Here is a YouTube video showing off a full stack application (Node, Express, MongoDB) that I worked on for my web dev class:
